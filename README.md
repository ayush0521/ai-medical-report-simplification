<h1 align="center">🩺 AI-Assisted Medical Report Simplification System</h1>

<p align="center">
  An AI-assisted educational system that converts complex medical reports into
  clear, patient-friendly explanations for non-clinical users.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>Educational and academic use only</em>
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>📌 Project Overview</h2>
<p>
  Medical reports are primarily written for healthcare professionals and often
  contain technical terminology that can be difficult for patients and
  non-clinical users to understand. This project aims to bridge that
  communication gap by simplifying medical report information into
  easy-to-understand explanations.
</p>

<p>
  The system combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language
  Processing (NLP), and rule-based interpretation to explain commonly used
  diagnostic parameters while strictly avoiding diagnosis or treatment
  recommendations.
</p>

<h2>🎯 Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Simplify medical report content for non-clinical users</li>
  <li>Improve understanding of common diagnostic test values</li>
  <li>Apply explainable, rule-based logic for safety and transparency</li>
  <li>Demonstrate responsible and ethical use of AI in healthcare education</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>🧠 System Workflow</h2>
<ol>
  <li>User uploads a medical report (PDF or image)</li>
  <li>Text extraction using OCR techniques</li>
  <li>Identification of test names and numerical values using NLP-based parsing</li>
  <li>Rule-based comparison with standard reference ranges</li>
  <li>Generation of simplified, patient-friendly explanations</li>
</ol>
